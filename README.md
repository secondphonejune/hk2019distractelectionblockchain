Since June 2019, Hong Kong people has started Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement to protect their own freedom and rights. Hong Kong will have a District Council Election on 24 Nov 2019. It is a great oppotunity for people to express their view to district council and government. However, there are concerns that Hong Kong government will pause or cancel the election in order to protect the interest of pro-government parties. That's why we have started this project, a folk election based on smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is to make sure the Hong Kong people, especially the young people who are familiar with the Internet, can express their views to the public All program codes and executions will be done in a open and transparent way. And the result will be as fair and just as possible.

In this project, nodejs keeps all files to be used in the web server, smartcontract keeps the smart contract files.
