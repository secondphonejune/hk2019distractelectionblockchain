 * This project is originally created to implement an election for 2019 Hong Kong local elections.
 * Ofcause the Hong Kong government is not going to use it, but we have a chance to show that how an election can be done completely anonymously with blockchain
 * Everyone can use the code provided in this project, but they must keep this statement here unchanged.
 * Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong
 * Five Demands, Not One Less
